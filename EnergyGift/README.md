## Usage

`EnergyGift` appears as the `gift` property on an [`EnergyTradeOffer`](../EnergyTradeOffer/).
A prosumer publishes an offer with `gift` set; the offer is listed at price 0. The intended recipient
discovers the offer by hashing their phone number and matching it to `lookupHash`. They claim
the gift by presenting the shared secret (pre-image of `claimVerifier`) in the `select` message.
